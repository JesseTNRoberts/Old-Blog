## Recursion and Universal function approximation yield Turing completeness: A Conjecture

The class of partial recursive functions is identical to the class of computable functions (in a Turing sense). A universal function approximator should be able to approximate any single evaluation of a partial recursive function. Essentially, this means that all axioms of recursion theory other than recursion should be learnable via a neural network. Then, when embued with recursion via passing the output back in as the input you can implement the class of partial recursive functions. 

This seems to be the case because neural networks, sans recursion, are universal function approximators and RNNs are known to be able to simulate a Turing machine which means it can approximate any partial recursive function. So, there is some good reasons to believe the conjecture is true.
