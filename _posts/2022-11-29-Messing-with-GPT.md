## Messing with GPT - 11/18

My goal for today is to get the hang of the API for GPT-3 or Interact-GPT and attempt zero shot chiasm generation. But I have several meetings throughout the day.

## House update

So, yesterday I did the first parts of installing the 2 ton gas package unit. It took all day, but I met my goal of having the unit in place and the ducts ran under the house. I'm probably 8 hours away from having the install complete. 


### Back to the lab again

So, it looks like OpenAI has a pay as you go model. I wonder if they have a free tier for researchers and education?

Well, I haven't found it if they do. But I did find [this](https://openai.com/blog/requests-for-research-2/). It's a set of open problems that they find promising. Some of them, specifically the linear attention transformation and RL pretraining, sound cool..

It turns out they do have subsidized research. But you have to signup first and then they give you the opportunity to apply for research subsidy. 

### Reporting back - 11/29

That was a long pause. Thanksgiving was... less good than usual. But I attribute this to a lack of planning. Activity planning is a good way to make holidays more predictably fun. So, for Christmas I am determined to plan the time allocated-ish to games etc. I did make some good homemade, orange maple cranberry sauce and overall, a good time was had. 

#### Central Heat and Air Install

The HVAC install is done and it is working well. I installed every piece of the system with the exception of the gas pipe from the meter. A true do-it-yourself central heat and air install from complete scratch (we didn't even have ducts). 

Below is the actual price breakdown of what I paid rounded a bit vs the best quoted price for the job. One note about this is that I also wound up with a gas stove installed from this essentially for free because I asked the gas installer to do both the stove and the unit gas piping at the same time. The value of having a gas stove hookup isn't considered in this table. 

My typical rate of pay for engineering consultin is 80 dollars per hour. So, my goal was to make at least that rate in savings (otherwise it wouldn't be worth the time). I wound up just beating that amount. It worked out well and the unit is working perfectly, however, I don't recommend this to people in general. 

If you understand (or can learn quickly) electrial wiring (wire sizing, breaker sizing, and low voltage control wiring), duct sizing (cfm per square foot, duct cross section area for a given cfm rating), supply and return air layout, and basic sheet metal work then this is doable. But a critical mistake at any point along the way could be disastrous (starting with knowing what kind of unit and tonnage to purchase and from where).
