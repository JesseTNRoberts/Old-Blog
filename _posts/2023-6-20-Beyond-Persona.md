## Beyond Persona

Hypothesis: prompting mediates psycholinguistic effects like typicality in language models. 

This suggests that persona prompting permits more than acting like the target. The statistics of the model may be altered to reflect the persona.

Existing work that analyzed the truth of a statement given a premise, aprapro of nothing, may not be a good experiment as the mediating situational context present in the psychological experiments is absent in language model experiments. 

- How does the shift in statistical distribution relate to the length of the context?
- Empirically show that the statistical distribution tends toward the base distribution for large $n$

This can be done by running the same typicality experiments early and late in a discourse to see statistical differences.

Based on the work of Hahn and my work on repetition, it may be ideal to have the model repeat the assumed identity every so many tokens. 

- What is the ideal repetition for maintenance of the persona across the discourse? 
Probably something like $O(k/n)$ or $O(k/log(n))$
