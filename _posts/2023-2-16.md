## Attention, Prediction, and Surprise


Reward is gained at greatest magnitude when something is predicted to be good but then turns out to be better. So, a prediction is made based on past experience filtered through attention. However, the result of the prediction is incorrect because the input was attended to with slight variation. This creates surprise. In future experiences, the new experience will help the prediction system to produce more accurate inferences and make attending to the input in a manner that produces surprise, difficult.

The above description casts prediction and attention as adversaries in an effort to supress (in the case of prediction) and create (in the case of attention) surprise.
