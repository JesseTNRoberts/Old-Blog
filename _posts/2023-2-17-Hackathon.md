## Hackathon Friday

Today I have a large segment of time where I don't have to work on other things. That's perfect for writing code. I think during coding sessions, I will allow myself to read things which are broader (probably about language model uses in stylometry today).  

Before I can begin answering a question, I need to read and annotate my page about thesis ideas. 

## The goal today is to answer a question
