## Messing with GPT

My goal for today is to get the hang of the API for GPT-3 or Interact-GPT and attempt zero shot chiasm generation. But I have several meetings throughout the day.

## House update

So, yesterday I did the first parts of installing the 2 ton gas package unit. It took all day, but I met my goal of having the unit in place and the ducts ran under the house. I'm probably 8 hours away from having the install complete. 


### Back to the lab again

So, it looks like OpenAI has a pay as you go model. I wonder if they have a free tier for researchers and education?

Well, I haven't found it if they do. But I did find [this](https://openai.com/blog/requests-for-research-2/). It's a set of open problems that they find promising. Some of them, specifically the linear attention transformation and RL pretraining, sound cool..

It turns out they do have subsidized research. But you have to signup first and then they give you the opportunity to apply for research subsidy.
