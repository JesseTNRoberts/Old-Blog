## Research plan for the near future


Currently my study of the theory of transformers is at the top of my list. Fundamental, theoretical research into the capabilities and the underlying mechanisms of these forms the foundation of my research.

On this foundation I will build work in 
1. computational linguistics
  - study of narrative, discourse, and argumentation  
  - ancient NLP
2. linguistically driven robotics
3. computational game theory
4. ADHD 
  - Based in the work done regarding repetition as an important process for memory maintenance in transformers (and a possible connection to working memory in humans)
