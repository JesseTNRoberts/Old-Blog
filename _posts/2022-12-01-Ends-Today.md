## It Ends Today

Today is the culminating project presentation for my capstone 2 students. So, a good deal of work for me happens next week in grading them. However, in the short term this gives me some additional time. 

## Today

My goal is to work with the GPT interface for 1 hour and write on my game theory paper for 1 hour. I have already asked for subsidized access to the GPT-3 API and am waiting on open-AI to respond. 

When those tasks are done, I will follow up with my collaborator on the ASEE papers.

## GPT

The following results were obtained via few shot learning and the GPT-3 playground:

Few shot training:

    ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban is a chiasm.
    citizen consumers rather than consumer citizens is a chiasm.
    Independence is language and language is independence is a chiasm.

    rules and laws and that laws and rules is not a chiasm.
    Directive is inapplicable in Denmark , or Denmark is required by the Directive is not a chiasm.

testing: 

    man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man is a chiasm.

    tabled amendments , that is , amendments tabled is not a chiasm.

The above testing was done by hand. So, the number of items used to test were small. However, this does give reason to believe that the model may already have an internal representation that is more than suitable to desegregate chiasma from non-chiasma.
