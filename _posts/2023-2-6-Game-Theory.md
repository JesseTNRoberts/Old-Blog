## Connecting Game Theory Work to LLM

- Does the text generated from language models exhibit symptoms of ADD? Could this related to the attention on the prompt and working memory?

## Finishing my work on the traveler's dilemma

- In what contexts is iterative reasoning more evolutionarily stable than wholistic reasoning?
- Show that iterative reasoning in non-deterministic computational time and space results in uncertainty regarding the weak domination of strategies
- Uncertainty in weakly dominated strategies makes the use of FWD reasonable

## Connections

There are interesting connections that can be drawn regarding theory of mind from the above. If an agent attempts to make sense of the actions of another agent while assuming that the other agent has unrestricted computational space and time, the agent will likely impute incorrect reasoning. As an example, in the case of the traveler's dilemma, choosing 100 can be seen as a risky decision while choosing 2 can be seen as a risk averse decision. However, the resulting choices can be shown to arise from the same preference relation which is insensitive to risk. Rather, the two strategies are chosen based on the agent's access to computational time and space.
