## Finish it: The Traveler's Dilemma

The traveler's dilemma is an interesting strategic scenario because it is a paradoxical game. It possesses a unique situation in which the players may actually obtain a better payoff if they do not act in accord with typical notions of rationality. Namely, they get a better outcome by ignoring the Nash equilibrium. 

However, I have found a compelling explanation for the phenomena which stems from computational considerations. The paradox exists because the game theoretic analysis is conducted without considering the impact of computational time and the underlying algorithm. 

The typical analysis in game theory makes 2 key (but unintentional) assumptions. First, it assumes that the agents have infinite computational time and space. Second, it assumes that agents' algorithmic selection of a strategy happens at the end of execution. 

When these assumptions are made explicit, they may be relaxed to evaluate the effect on the predicted equilibrium. Importantly, when computational time and space is no longer assumed infinite, and it is allowed that the agent themselves may be uncertain of afforded computational time, it is no longer tenable to assume that a preference algorithm would only provide output upon completion of execution. Rather, the algorithm would provide a continually updated best strategy.  

The result is that stochastic computational space and time may cause agents to terminate before the algorithm converges.

The claim is not that if infinite time is given to a player, the Nash equilibrium would be selected. Rather, the claim is that if players had developed in societies with infinite and deterministic computational resources then players would select the Nash equilibrium. However, that is not the case. They have limited computational resources with limited predictability regarding allocation. Therefore, they have optimized expectations of opponents based on these conditions.
